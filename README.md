# scf
Simple Container Framework (SCF) - STL-like implementation of "list", "vector" and "map" for C by using C preprocessor macros

This is a very old code I wrote years before when I was student. It works, but you should now that it **does not free memory**.
I used this code at my current company to make old C code more usable and now I have an update in the pipe to fix this memory issue.
But it takes some time to reimplement it.
